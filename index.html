              <h3>Breaking Barriers: A Womans Journey in the Software Industry</h3>
              <p>Writen by Arzu Caner on March 27, 2023</p>
              <p>I have stepped into another industry where it is difficult to be a woman. I say 
              this because statistics present some striking results.

              The first statistic that highlights the gender distribution in the sector shows 
              that unfortunately, only about 5% are women. (Statista) Also, when we look at 
              other research results on Exploding Topics, we see that companies with more than 
              10,000 employees report that women make up 26.2% of their workforce.
            
              This statistic leads us to another question: Why is the number of women so low in 
              the software industry?
            
              Some articles I have read on this subject have stated that the underrepresentation 
              of women in the sector is one of the most important factors. 

              They also highlight that recruitment processes in the software industry can be 
              biased against women, resulting in fewer women being hired or promoted.
            
              Moreover, some women have feeling excluded or marginalized in the software industry 
              due to the prevalence of a “bro culture” in some workplaces.
            
              Finally, these articles note that the demanding nature and long working hours of 
              software development can be especially challenging for women who have caregiving 
              responsibilities outside of work.
            
              There are many communities working to empower women and give them a voice in this 
              sector, and I am a member of some of these communities, including Lonca, Women Who 
              Code London, Women Who Code and Women Who Code Frontend. These communities are 
              working hard to help women develop their skills and become leaders in the industry.
            
              I hope that the software industry becomes a sector with a higher number of women in 
              the coming years.
            
              As a woman in this industry, I am now here too, and I am excited to see what 
              experiences we will encounter on this long journey. Lets see what the future holds!
