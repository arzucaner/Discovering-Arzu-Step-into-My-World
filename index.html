                <h3>Breaking Barriers: A Woman's Journey in the Software Industry</h3>                
                <p>Written by Arzu Caner on March 27, 2023</p>
                <p>I have stepped into another industry where it is difficult to be a woman. I say this because statistics present some 
                striking results.</p>

                <p>The first statistic that highlights the gender distribution in the sector shows that unfortunately, only about 5% are 
                women. (Statista) Also, when we look at other research results on Exploding Topics, we see that companies with more than 
                10,000 employees report that women make up 26.2% of their workforce.</p>
            
                <p>This statistic leads us to another question: Why is the number of women so low in the software industry?</p>
            
                <p>Some articles I have read on this subject have stated that the underrepresentation of women in the sector is one of 
                the most important factors. They also highlight that recruitment processes in the software industry can be biased 
                against women, resulting in fewer women being hired or promoted.</p>
            
                <p>Moreover, some women have felt excluded or marginalized in the software industry due to the prevalence of a "bro 
                culture" in some workplaces.</p>
            
                <p>Finally, these articles note that the demanding nature and long working hours of software development can be 
                especially challenging for women who have caregiving responsibilities outside of work.</p>
            
                <p>There are many communities working to empower women and give them a voice in this sector, and I am a member of some 
                of these communities, including Lonca, Women Who Code London, Women Who Code, and Women Who Code Frontend. These 
                communities are working hard to help women develop their skills and become leaders in the industry.</p>
            
                <p>I hope that the software industry becomes</p>
